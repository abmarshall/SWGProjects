  <h1>Loveless</h1>
  <h2>My Bloody Valentine</h2>
  <h3>1991</h3>
  <p>"Loveless is the second studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine. Released on the 4th of November in 1991. The album was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled feedback and percussion. The group cycled through nineteen studios and a larger number of engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000."
